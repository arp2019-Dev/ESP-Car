# ESP-Car

This car uses wifi and an esp32 and esp8266 to control a 3d printed car, the car uses a small a12212 bldc motor and a simple 30amp esc with 12v hooked up. The ESP8266 serves as the receiver and gets the speed value and steering values using a potentiometer connected to the ESP 32, for steering I am using a simple mg90 servo, I have not printed it out to test but it should work with the code since I used a simulator to test it. The parts of the car are printed in PLA but the tires are made of tpu. I only used M3 screws in the design and some parts use threaded inserts to help with strength,
